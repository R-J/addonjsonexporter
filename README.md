# addon.json Exporter

This Vanilla forums plugin is targeted towards developers. Plugin meta information should be saved to a file called "addon.json" and this plugin should help developers by converting their $PluginInfo array to that JSON oriented file.

It will display all the information Vanilla has stored for a plugin. You really should clean up the output before saving the JSON to the file.
